Created a report using Global Superstore data files. First restored the Global Superstore database in Excel server and then created report in Power BI with a ‘Summary’ page showing the ‘Top Selling Products’ and ‘Top buying Customers’ with their respective ‘Regions’. Added a ‘Sales by Segment’ and ‘Sales by Market’ page showing the customers’s information in detail and last the ‘Product Details’ page reflecting the details of products ordered. We could easily navigate between the pages using Drillthrough options.
